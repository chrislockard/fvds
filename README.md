FVDS - Free Virtual Disk Space

This tool's purpose is to automatically clean package manager caches and perform disk trim operations using fstrim. I wrote this for my virtual machines to keep them trimmed up.

**Warning: this tool's purpose is to *delete* data! Be careful when using this and do not run it if you don't fully understand the consequences!**
